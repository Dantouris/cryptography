# CRYPTOGRAPHY
This directory contains simple implementations of some of the main cryptography algorithms.

I will add the algorithms as I code them.

**NOTE:** These cryptographic implementations are just 'educational' implementations to show and understand how the algorithms work, but should not be used in 'serious' cryptographic environments, as these implementations could be subject to simple attacks (which I may code as well.. - e.g. timing attack on DES, ..).

## Data Encryption Standard - DES

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

## Fiestel Cipher
Block cipher used in other algorithms such as DES.

## RC4
Stream cipher used in WPA, WEP, TLS/SSL, Remote Desktop, ...
