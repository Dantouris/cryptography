# CRYPTOGRAPHY
This directory contains simple implementations of some of the main cryptography algorithms.<br/>
I will add the algorithms as I code them.

## Data Encryption Standard - DES

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

## Fiestel Cipher
Block cipher used in other algorithms such as DES.

## RC4
Stream cipher used in WPA, WEP, TLS/SSL, Remote Desktop, ...
